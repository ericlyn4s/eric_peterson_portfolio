# Eric Peterson's Portfolio

## Description

Part of the curriculum of my coding bootcamp includes weekly projects to practice the prior week's lessons. As of the time of writing, I've completed the following projects:

    (1) a prework study guide that houses important notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript 
    (2) a mockup SaaS website where I refactored the code to be more accessible
    (3) this portfolio, which I built from scratch and will continue to add to

This portfolio will allow me to showcase my work to future employers. It also serves as a great example of my current web development skills, and I'm sure this project will evolve and improve alongside my skillset. Building this in week 2 of the bootcamp was undisputably challenging, but I learned how to write HTML and CSS together in a real scenario. My goal for this portfolio is to have a sophisticated and impressive display of several projects by the time I apply to jobs.
