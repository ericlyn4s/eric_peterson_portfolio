            <h3>I currently work as a senior operations analyst at an education technology company named Guild. My day-to-day consists of synthesizing & auditing data but has gradually required more techinical skills. This led to SQL and Python courses, after which I decided to continue my learning and enroll in the 2U/UT coding bootcamp. I'm excited about the education I'm about to receive in this intensive program. I'll be updating this portfolio to exhibit my projects and demonstrate my learnings!</h3>
