        <h3>I currently work as a senior operations analyst at Guild, an education technology company based in Denver. My day-to-day consists of synthesizing & auditing data but has gradually required more techinical skills. This led to learning various coding languages such as SQL and Python, throughout which I've developed a wider interest in software development. I'm now enrolled in the coding bootcamp at 2U/UT Austin Texas, where I'm learning programming / software development essentials. I'll be updating this portfolio to exhibit my projects and demonstrate my learnings!</h3>    </section>
